*OnlineStore*

Emulation of purchases in an online store (registration of customers and a log of purchases).

Buyers by type of activity are divided into:
1. Active - made purchases during August 2021;
2. Inactive - all others.

Implemented:
1. Registration of a new customer: name, surname, date of birth and phone number.
2. Logging of purchaser purchases: month of purchase, purchaser, total cost, payment method (cash / card).
3. Output to the console of a report with purchases of customers, grouped by type of activity (active / inactive) and months, with details on the type of payment (cash / card). Cases are taken into account when the buyer paid for part of the purchases in cash, and part for the card.
